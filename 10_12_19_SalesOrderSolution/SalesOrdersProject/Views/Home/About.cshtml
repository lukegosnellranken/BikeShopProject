        We live and breathe cycling. Luke's Bike Emporium is a full-service bike retailer, carrying a broad assortment of bike brands, components and accessories,
        and our repair shops are staffed with some of the best-trained professionals in the industry.

        Our friendly expert Service Advisors are specially trained to help guide and evaluate your bike service needs.
        No matter what your familiarity might be with bikes, you'll get exactly the right help.

    <p class="paragraph">
        All of our repair shops are staffed with highly qualified Master Technicians. The Master Tech in each store is responsible for training the bike shop staff,
        ensuring that we're well-equipped to handle all types of service, and help get your bike the best care possible.

        Each Master Technician attends an intensive, hands-on certification program at the Barnett Bicycle Institute in Colorado Springs, CO.
        This ensures that our shops possess the highest level of technical skill out there—including expertise with modern suspension technology,
        and leading-edge hydraulic systems and drivetrains.
